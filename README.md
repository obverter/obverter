# Oh hi. I'm Ben.

I'm an overenthusiastic data herder who spends a shedload of time worrying and writing about, among other things, **[ergodic fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_literature)** and **[millionaires standing around outside in their pajamas](https://www.fangraphs.com/)**.

I am a shameless dilettante, and I am an indiscriminate connoisseur of **[pub trivia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Random)**.

When I'm not being productive, I enjoy photoshopping my friends and loved ones into pictures of places they've never been, sending those files to a print lab to be rendered and tastefully framed, and then covertly [droplifting](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/droplifting#:~:text=Noun,form%20of%20countercultural%20performance%20art) those lies onto a wall, desk, or mantle in their homes. 

Some have hung unnoticed for ***years***.

In my free time enjoy collecting hobbies, giving up on personal projects, and frisbeeing my [dog](https://www.instagram.com/dangerkermit) into the Shadow Realm.

Also I run a boutique [environmental engineering consultancy](https://www.readylimit.com/).

## 🧑‍💻 What I do:

I find and write about interesting, albiet often broadly inconsequential [data](https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*6c9bsATfG5snMP-j4RT2cw.png)[^1] or **[anomalies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/10/AR2007081001606_pf.html)**. In this doomscrolly world we live in, I try to spend energy on making, curating, and foregrounding miniature meaninfullnesses and positive debris.

If there existed a single screengrab that comprised the intersection of my journalistic interests, intellectual passions, irreverential jollifications, and penchant to celebrate the irremarkable — it might look something like this:

## 🤷‍♂️ Where I wonder:

I'm interested in Normative Decision Theory as can be applied to the completely irrational:

Let's say that I could fling a basketball backward, over my head, and drain it from anywhere on the court: 

>Full court, diving out of bounds?
                   
Nothing but net.
                    
>Free throw for the Game 7 dagger before a hostile crowd? 
                   
Watch me yawn.
                    
>Shaq and Kareem double-team in the corner? 

How 'bout I bank it off the top of the glass.

---

So if I could make that shot _100% of the time_ — pure 100%, no rounding — would you stick me on an NBA bench, knowing full well that I'd about as useful as a toddler when it came time to play defense?

I mean, maybe. 

Hell, maybe even **probably**.

Okay, so what about 99% of the time?

98%?

_95%...?_

There comes a point where I'm not worth the roster slot. **_But what is that point?_**[^2]

These are the difficult questions that deserve solid answers. These are the sorts of places I like to play.

[^2]: It still might be 100%.

## 🧑‍🚀 The People I've Been:

I come from a literature background. I spent a minute in the basement of the Ivory Tower researching [grumpy, dead poets](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Commandeering_Death/Ad6YQwAACAAJ?hl=en) who would have been absolutely wild on Twitter.

After that, I wrote a [novel](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Sifting_Through_Static/4rjqsgEACAAJ?hl=en) that garnered ones and ones of rave reviews.

Since then, I've edited some [textbooks](https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Day_in_the_Life_of_an_American_Worker/t7S8xAEACAAJ?hl=en) and lent a hand with some [articles](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00220-2).
